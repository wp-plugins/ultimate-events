== Usage == 

To add an event go to the Ultimate Events Menu page and click Add New!
Complete the form and click the Submit button to save the event. 

To display events on your website and allow other users to subscribe to 
events add the [ultievt_display] shortcode to your wordpress page.

To display everyone's availability for various events, use the 
[ultievt_availability] shortcode in your wordpress page.

Editing events and also copying the data from events can be done in the 
Ultimate Events menu page inside the wordpress admin section.

Managing other users attendance can be done by the events admin via the 
'Manage Attendance' page included with the plugins backend.
